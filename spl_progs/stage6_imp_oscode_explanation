explanation of os startup code of stage 6 and how page table and everything must be initialised
loadi(65,7);
loadi(66,8);
loadi(22,35);
loadi(23,36);
loadi(2, 15);
loadi(3, 16);
till above everything same as for sample code stage 6
 PTBR = PAGE_TABLE_BASE;
 PTLR=9 since logical page no start from 0 to PTLR-1 and we wanted logical page 8 in assg so we have PTLR=9
 location of page table entry =ptbr+2*logical page number
 so we want the first page of code in logical page 4 so ptbr+2*4 must contain page 65 and similarly others
 and remaining except these must have auxilary info as "0000" and first word as 0(that is first word denote page number maybe we might need to initialise it to -1)
 [PTBR+8] = 65;
[PTBR+9] = "0100";
[PTBR+10] = 66;
[PTBR+11] = "0100";
[PTBR+16] = 76;
[PTBR+17] = "0110";
[76*512] = 2048;(this is the physical address of stack pointer 79*512 and this must contain the first application program to be executed as per abi and our logical address of first user instruction is present in page 4and page 4 address start from 4*512 

SP = 8*512; since stack pointer logically begins on logical page 8 whose address starts from 8*512
ireturn;
this instruction is to switch the machine mode from kernel mode to user mode
